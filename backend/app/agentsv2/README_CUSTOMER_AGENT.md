# Customer Agent - Healthcare Orchestrator

## Overview

The Customer Agent is a sophisticated healthcare orchestrator that serves as the main entry point for user interactions in the healthcare app. It understands user intent, creates execution plans, and coordinates between specialized agents to fulfill healthcare requests.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`customer_workflow.py`** - Main LangGraph workflow implementation
2. **`customer_agent.py`** - Wrapper class for easy integration

### Workflow Steps

```
User Input → Intent Classification → Information Assessment → Plan Creation → Execution → Response Synthesis
                                           ↓
                                    Ask Clarification Questions
```

## Intent Classification

The system recognizes 6 main intent types:

### 1. `upload_document`
- **Description**: User wants to upload and process a document
- **Examples**: "Upload my lab report", "Process this prescription image"
- **Target Agents**: `document_workflow`, `lab_agent`, `pharmacy_agent`

### 2. `update_data`
- **Description**: User wants to add/update health data
- **Sub-categories**: `vitals`, `nutrition`, `prescription`
- **Examples**: "Update my blood pressure to 120/80", "Log my breakfast"
- **Target Agents**: `vitals_agent`, `nutrition_agent`, `pharmacy_agent`

### 3. `query_data`
- **Description**: User wants to retrieve/view existing health data
- **Examples**: "Show my nutrition data from last week", "What's my latest blood pressure?"
- **Target Agents**: `vitals_agent`, `nutrition_agent`, `lab_agent`

### 4. `analysis_request`
- **Description**: User wants analysis or recommendations
- **Examples**: "Give me nutrition recommendations", "Analyze my lab trends"
- **Target Agents**: `nutrition_agent`, `medical_doctor_panels`

### 5. `symptom_diagnosis`
- **Description**: User is asking about symptoms or health concerns
- **Examples**: "I have a headache and feel tired", "What could cause chest pain?"
- **Target Agents**: `medical_doctor_panels`

### 6. `general_question`
- **Description**: General healthcare questions
- **Examples**: "What is cholesterol?", "How often should I exercise?"
- **Target Agents**: `medical_doctor_panels`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.agentsv2.customer_agent import CustomerAgent

# Create agent
agent = CustomerAgent()

# Process a request
result = agent.process_request(
    user_id="user123",
    user_input="I want to upload my lab report and ask about my cholesterol levels"
)

print(result["final_response"])
```

### Async Usage

```python
import asyncio
from app.agentsv2.customer_agent import CustomerAgent

async def main():
    agent = CustomerAgent()
    result = await agent.process_request_async(
        user_id="user123",
        user_input="Update my blood pressure to 120/80",
        conversation_history=[
            {"user": "Hello", "assistant": "Hi! How can I help you today?"}
        ]
    )
    print(result["final_response"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Quick Processing

```python
from app.agentsv2.customer_agent import quick_process

response = quick_process("user123", "Show me my nutrition data from today")
print(response)
```

## Response Format

The agent returns a comprehensive dictionary with:

```python
{
    "user_input": str,                    # Original user input
    "intent_classification": dict,        # Classified intent details
    "execution_plan": dict,              # Generated execution plan
    "agent_results": dict,               # Results from each agent step
    "final_response": str,               # Final response to user
    "error": str,                        # Any error messages
    "processing_complete": bool,         # Whether processing finished
    "requires_user_input": bool,         # If clarification needed
    "clarification_questions": list,     # Questions for user
    "agent_name": str,                   # "CustomerAgent"
    "timestamp": str                     # ISO timestamp
}
```

## Features

### Intent Classification
- **Hybrid Approach**: Uses LLM + rule-based fallback for reliability
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 90-95% confidence on healthcare requests
- **Context Aware**: Considers conversation history for better classification

### Information Assessment
- **Completeness Check**: Validates if enough information is available
- **Smart Questions**: Generates relevant clarification questions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation state

### Execution Planning
- **Multi-Step Plans**: Creates detailed execution sequences
- **Agent Orchestration**: Maps intents to appropriate specialized agents
- **Fallback Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery

### Response Synthesis
- **Context Synthesis**: Combines results from multiple agents
- **Healthcare Tone**: Professional yet empathetic communication
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides clear next steps when appropriate

## Available Agents Integration

The customer agent coordinates with these specialized agents:

- **`document_workflow`**: Process uploaded documents (PDF, images)
- **`lab_agent`**: Handle lab reports and results analysis
- **`nutrition_agent`**: Nutrition data and recommendations
- **`vitals_agent`**: Vital signs and measurements
- **`pharmacy_agent`**: Prescription and medication management
- **`prescription_clinical_agent`**: Clinical prescription analysis
- **`medical_doctor_panels`**: Medical analysis and recommendations

## Example Interactions

### Document Upload + Question
```
User: "I want to upload my lab report and ask about my cholesterol levels"
Intent: upload_document (confidence: 0.90)
Plan: 
  1. Process document using document_workflow
  2. Analyze content using lab_agent
  3. Generate response using synthesis
Response: "I'll help you process your lab report and answer your cholesterol questions..."
```

### Data Update
```
User: "Can you update my blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg?"
Intent: update_data (confidence: 0.95)
Subcategory: vitals
Plan:
  1. Extract data using parser
  2. Update database using vitals_agent
  3. Confirm update using synthesis
Response: "I've successfully updated your blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg..."
```

### Symptom Inquiry
```
User: "I have a headache and feel tired, what could be wrong?"
Intent: symptom_diagnosis (confidence: 0.95)
Plan:
  1. Process query using medical_doctor_panels
  2. Generate response using synthesis
Response: "I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. Headaches and fatigue can have several causes..."
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For LLM operations
- Database connection settings for agent coordination

### Dependencies
All required packages are in `requirements.txt`:
- `langgraph>=0.4.8`
- `langchain-openai`
- `pydantic`

## Testing

Run the built-in test suite:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.agentsv2.customer_agent
```

This will test all intent types and verify the workflow is functioning correctly.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Agent Integration**: Currently uses simulated agent calls - implement actual agent integration
2. **Memory Persistence**: Add conversation memory across sessions
3. **Advanced Planning**: More sophisticated multi-step plan generation
4. **Performance Metrics**: Add timing and success rate tracking
5. **Custom Tools**: Integration with external healthcare APIs

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler approaches when advanced features fail
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Converts technical errors to helpful user messages
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Access Control**: User ID validation for data access
- **Error Boundaries**: Prevents sensitive information leakage in error messages
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains logs of all agent interactions
