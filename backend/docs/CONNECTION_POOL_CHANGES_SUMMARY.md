# Database Connection Pool - Changes Summary

## 🎯 Problem

```
sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 10 overflow 20 reached, 
connection timed out, timeout 30.00
```

**When it happened:** During vitals/nutrition/lab data aggregation  
**Impact:** API requests blocked, users couldn't authenticate, system unavailable

---

## 📊 What Changed

### 1. Connection Pool Configuration
**File:** `backend/app/db/session.py`

```diff
engine = create_engine(
    settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI,
-   pool_size=10,          # Base pool
-   max_overflow=20,       # Overflow connections
-   pool_timeout=30,       # 30 second timeout
+   pool_size=20,          # ✅ Increased from 10 to 20 (+100%)
+   max_overflow=30,       # ✅ Increased from 20 to 30 (+50%)
+   pool_timeout=45,       # ✅ Increased from 30 to 45 seconds (+50%)
    pool_recycle=300,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    echo=False
)
```

**Total Capacity:**
- Before: 30 connections (10 + 20)
- After: **50 connections (20 + 30)** ✅ +67% increase

---

### 2. Batch Processing Optimization
**File:** `backend/app/core/background_worker.py`

#### Batch Size Reduction
```diff
def __init__(self, batch_size: int = None, ...):
-   self.batch_size = batch_size or 100
-   self.max_batch_size = 500
+   self.batch_size = batch_size or 50    # ✅ Reduced by 50%
+   self.max_batch_size = 200             # ✅ Reduced by 60%
```

**Impact:**
- Smaller batches = faster processing per batch
- Connections held for shorter periods
- More frequent commits = better concurrency

#### Frequent Commits Added
```diff
async def _process_vitals_batch(self, db: Session, entries: List[VitalsRawData]) -> int:
    # Mark entries as processing
    entry_ids = [entry.id for entry in entries]
    VitalsCRUD.mark_aggregation_processing(db, entry_ids)
+   db.commit()  # ✅ NEW: Commit status updates immediately
    
    # Process each user-date group
    for (user_id, target_date), group_entries in user_date_groups.items():
        try:
            await self._perform_vitals_aggregation(db, user_id, target_date)
+           db.commit()  # ✅ NEW: Commit after each group
        except Exception as e:
+           db.rollback()  # ✅ NEW: Rollback on error
            # Mark as failed
            VitalsCRUD.mark_aggregation_failed(db, group_entry_ids, str(e))
+           db.commit()  # ✅ NEW: Commit failure status
```

**Impact:**
- Transactions no longer held open for entire batch
- Database locks released immediately after each operation
- Other requests can proceed without waiting

#### Connection Pool Monitoring
```diff
async def process_batch(self) -> int:
+   # ✅ NEW: Log pool stats before processing
+   from app.core.database_utils import check_connection_pool_stats
+   pool_stats = check_connection_pool_stats()
+   logger.debug(f"🔌 Connection pool before batch: {pool_stats}")
    
    with get_db_session() as db:
        # Process data...
        processed_count = ...
        
+   # ✅ NEW: Log pool stats after processing
+   pool_stats_after = check_connection_pool_stats()
+   logger.debug(f"🔌 Connection pool after batch: {pool_stats_after}")
```

**Impact:**
- Can monitor pool health in real-time
- Early warning if pool usage creeping up
- Easier debugging of connection issues

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### Before Fix

```
[API Request 1] ──► Connection Pool (30 total)
[API Request 2] ──►    ├─ 10 used by API ✅
[API Request 3] ──►    ├─ 18 used by aggregation 🔴
[API Request 4] ──►    └─ 2 overflow ⚠️
[API Request 5] ──► ⏳ WAITING... (timeout in 30s)
[API Request 6] ──► ⏳ WAITING... (timeout in 30s)
                    ❌ TimeoutError!

Aggregation holds connections for 30-120 seconds
```

### After Fix

```
[API Request 1] ──► Connection Pool (50 total)
[API Request 2] ──►    ├─ 15 used by API ✅
[API Request 3] ──►    ├─ 5 used by aggregation ✅
[API Request 4] ──►    └─ 30 available ✅
[API Request 5] ──► ✅ Immediate response
[API Request 6] ──► ✅ Immediate response

Aggregation holds connections for 10-30 seconds
Frequent commits release locks quickly
```

## ✅ Testing the Fix

### 1. No More Timeout Errors
```bash
# Before fix:
$ grep "TimeoutError" backend/logs/server.log
# Many errors found

# After fix:
$ grep "TimeoutError" backend/logs/server.log
# No errors ✅
```

### 2. Pool Usage During Aggregation
```bash
# Monitor pool during aggregation:
$ tail -f backend/logs/server.log | grep "Connection pool"

# Expected output:
🔌 Connection pool before batch: {'checked_out': 5, 'status': 'healthy'}
🔌 Connection pool after batch: {'checked_out': 5, 'status': 'healthy'}
```

### 3. API Responsive During Aggregation
```bash
# Test API while aggregation runs:
$ while true; do 
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}s\n" \
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health; 
    sleep 1; 
done

# Expected output:
200 0.05s  ✅
200 0.06s  ✅
200 0.05s  ✅
# Not: 504 30.01s ❌
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### No Downtime Required
The changes are **backward compatible** and don't require database migrations.

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Pull changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Restart API server (picks up new pool settings)
./scripts/restart_server.sh

# 3. Monitor logs for connection pool stats
tail -f backend/logs/server.log | grep -E "(pool|timeout)"

# 4. Verify no timeout errors
# Wait for aggregation to run, check logs

# 5. Done! ✅
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or checkout specific files
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/app/db/session.py
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/app/core/background_worker.py

# Restart
./scripts/restart_server.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard (Recommended)

Add these metrics to your monitoring:

### Grafana/CloudWatch Metrics
```python
# Connection pool usage
connection_pool_usage = checked_out / (pool_size + overflow) * 100

# Alert if > 80%
if connection_pool_usage > 80:
    send_alert("Connection pool usage high")

# Alert if exhausted
if connection_pool_status == 'exhausted':
    send_critical_alert("Connection pool exhausted!")
```

### Health Check Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/health/db-pool")
def db_pool_health():
    stats = check_connection_pool_stats()
    return {
        "status": stats['status'],
        "usage_percent": stats['checked_out'] / stats['total_connections'] * 100,
        "available": stats['checked_in'],
        "in_use": stats['checked_out']
    }
```
