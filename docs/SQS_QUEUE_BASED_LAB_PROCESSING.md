# SQS Queue-Based Processing Implementation (Labs, Vitals, Nutrition)

## Summary
Replaced the in-memory smart aggregation trigger with a robust SQS queue-based approach for **ALL data processing** (labs, vitals, nutrition). This enables **scale-to-zero** functionality for the Fargate ML worker, significantly reducing costs while maintaining exact processing logic and order.

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Smart Aggregation)
```
Data Upload (Labs/Vitals/Nutrition) → API → trigger_smart_aggregation()
                                               ↓
                                      In-memory timer (30s delay)
                                               ↓
                                      Background worker (EC2, always-on)
```
**Issues:**
- In-memory state (lost on restart)
- No durable queuing
- Worker must run continuously
- Cannot scale to zero
- EC2 instance always running ($30/month)

### After (SQS Queue-Based)
```
Labs Upload     → API → SQS Message → Fargate ML Worker (scales 0-1)
                                       ↓
                                  BioBERT Categorization
                                       ↓
                                  Lab Aggregation (daily/monthly/quarterly/yearly)

Vitals Sync     → API → SQS Message → Fargate ML Worker (scales 0-1)
                                       ↓
                                  Copy to categorized with LOINC
                                       ↓
                                  Vitals Aggregation (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)

Nutrition Entry → API → SQS Message → Fargate ML Worker (scales 0-1)
                                       ↓
                                  Nutrition Aggregation (daily/weekly/monthly)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Durable message queue (survives restarts)
- ✅ Scale-to-zero when idle (cost savings: ~$28.80/month saved)
- ✅ Auto-scale on queue depth
- ✅ Decoupled architecture
- ✅ Retry and dead-letter queue support
- ✅ Same processing logic and order as before

## Code Changes

### 1. SQS Client (`backend/app/utils/sqs_client.py`)
**Added THREE trigger methods:**

```python
def send_lab_processing_trigger(self, user_id: int, priority: str = "normal") -> Optional[str]:
    """Send trigger to process pending lab reports"""
    
def send_vitals_processing_trigger(self, user_id: int, priority: str = "normal") -> Optional[str]:
    """Send trigger to process pending vitals data"""
    
def send_nutrition_processing_trigger(self, user_id: int, priority: str = "normal") -> Optional[str]:
    """Send trigger to process pending nutrition data"""
```

**Purpose:** Send lightweight SQS messages when data is uploaded (labs/vitals/nutrition)

### 2. Lab Agent (`backend/app/agentsv2/lab_agent.py`)
**Changed:** Line 1287-1301
```python
# OLD: Trigger smart aggregation (in-memory)
asyncio.create_task(trigger_smart_aggregation(user_id=cleaned_result.get('user_id'), domains=["labs"]))

# NEW: Trigger ML worker via SQS (durable queue)
ml_worker_client = get_ml_worker_client()
if ml_worker_client.is_enabled():
    ml_worker_client.send_lab_processing_trigger(
        user_id=cleaned_result.get('user_id'),
        priority='normal'
    )
```

**Purpose:** Send SQS message instead of in-memory trigger after lab insertion

### 3. ML Worker (`backend/app/services/ml_worker.py`)
**Added THREE processing methods (exact replicas of background_worker.py logic):**

```python
def _process_pending_labs(self, job_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """
    Process all pending lab reports
    
    Steps (EXACT order from background_worker.py):
    1. Get pending reports from lab_report_raw
    2. Categorize using BioBERT fuzzy matching
    3. Transfer to lab_report_categorized
    4. Aggregate into daily/monthly/quarterly/yearly tables
    """

def _process_pending_vitals(self, job_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """
    Process all pending vitals data
    
    Steps (EXACT order from background_worker.py):
    1. Get pending entries from vitals_raw_data
    2. Group by user_id and date
    3. Mark as processing
    4. For each user/date:
       - Copy raw to categorized with LOINC
       - Aggregate hourly data
       - Aggregate daily data
       - Aggregate weekly data (week starts Monday)
       - Aggregate monthly data
       - Mark categorized as aggregated
    5. On error: mark as failed
    """

def _process_pending_nutrition(self, job_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """
    Process all pending nutrition data
    
    Steps (EXACT order from background_worker.py):
    1. Get pending entries from nutrition_raw_data
    2. Group by user_id and meal_date
    3. Mark as processing
    4. For each user/date:
       - Aggregate daily data
       - Aggregate weekly data (week starts Monday)
       - Aggregate monthly data
    5. On error: mark as failed
    """
```

**Purpose:** Handle all three job types from SQS, maintaining exact processing logic

### 4. Terraform Configuration

#### SSM Parameters (`infra/terraform/modules/ssm/`)
**Added:**
- `/zivohealth/production/ml_worker/queue_url` - SQS queue URL for API
- `/zivohealth/production/ml_worker/enabled` - Enable/disable flag

#### Main Terraform (`infra/terraform/main.tf`)
**Changed:** Worker mode to "sqs"
```hcl
worker_mode = "sqs"  # Process SQS messages only (enables scale-to-zero)
```

---

## Environment Variables

### API Container (EC2)
The following environment variables are read from SSM and enable the API to send SQS messages:

```bash
ML_WORKER_ENABLED=true                                  # Enable SQS triggering
ML_WORKER_SQS_QUEUE_URL=https://sqs.us-east-1...       # Queue URL from Terraform
AWS_REGION=us-east-1                                    # AWS region
```

These are automatically populated from SSM parameters after `terraform apply`.

### ML Worker Container (Fargate)
```bash
ML_WORKER_MODE=sqs                                      # Process SQS messages only
ML_WORKER_SQS_QUEUE_URL=https://sqs.us-east-1...       # Queue URL
ML_WORKER_BATCH_SIZE=1                                  # Process 1 message at a time
ML_WORKER_WAIT_TIME=20                                  # Long polling (20s)
ML_WORKER_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT=300                        # 5 minutes to process
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

---

## Execution Flow

### 1. Lab Upload
```
User uploads lab report
    ↓
API receives lab image/PDF
    ↓
GPT-4 Vision extracts lab data
    ↓
Lab data inserted into lab_report_raw table
    ↓
SQS message sent: { "job_type": "process_pending_labs", "user_id": 123 }
```

### 2. ML Worker Processing (Fargate Auto-Starts)
```
SQS message arrives in queue (depth > 0)
    ↓
CloudWatch alarm triggers (queue depth >= 5)
    ↓
ECS Auto-Scaling starts Fargate task (0 → 1)
    ↓
ML Worker polls SQS (receives message)
    ↓
Worker fetches pending reports from lab_report_raw
    ↓
BioBERT categorization (fuzzy LOINC matching)
    ↓
Transfer to lab_report_categorized
    ↓
Aggregate into:
  - lab_report_daily
  - lab_report_monthly
  - lab_report_quarterly
  - lab_report_yearly
    ↓
Delete SQS message (success)
    ↓
Queue empty → Worker scales to 0 after idle period
```

### 3. Scale-to-Zero
```
Queue depth = 0 (no messages)
    ↓
CloudWatch alarm: scale-in condition met
    ↓
ECS Auto-Scaling reduces desired count to 0
    ↓
Fargate task stops
    ↓
💰 No charges (until next message)
```

---

## Cost Savings

### Before (Always-On Background Worker)
```
EC2 t3.medium (4GB RAM): $30/month
Running 24/7 for background aggregation
```

### After (Scale-to-Zero Fargate Spot)
```
Fargate Spot (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM):
- Idle time (queue empty): $0/hour
- Active time (processing): ~$0.02/hour
- Average usage: 2 hours/day
- Monthly cost: ~$1.20/month

💰 Savings: ~$28.80/month (96% reduction)
```

---

## Auto-Scaling Configuration

### SQS Queue
```hcl
message_retention_seconds = 86400        # 24 hours
visibility_timeout_seconds = 300         # 5 minutes
receive_wait_time_seconds = 20           # Long polling
```

### Fargate Service
```hcl
min_capacity       = 0                   # Scale to zero when idle
max_capacity       = 5                   # Up to 5 workers for high load
target_queue_depth = 5                   # Start worker when 5+ messages per task
```

### CloudWatch Alarms
- **Scale-Out:** Queue depth >= 5 messages per task → Scale up (max 5 tasks)
- **Scale-In:** Queue depth = 0 for 5 minutes → Scale down to 0

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Terraform Changes
```bash
cd /Users/rajanishsd/Documents/ZivohealthPlatform/infra/terraform
export AWS_PROFILE=zivohealth
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**What it does:**
- Creates SQS queue for ML worker
- Updates SSM parameters with queue URL
- Sets worker mode to "sqs"
- Configures auto-scaling (0-1 tasks)

### 2. Seed SSM Parameters on EC2
```bash
# SSH to EC2
ssh ec2-user@<ec2-ip>

# Run SSM seed script (pulls queue URL from SSM)
cd /home/ec2-user/ZivohealthPlatform
./scripts/dev/seed_ssm_from_env.sh

# Restart API containers to pick up new env vars
docker-compose restart backend
```

### 3. Build and Push ML Worker Image
```bash
# On local machine
cd /Users/rajanishsd/Documents/ZivohealthPlatform

# Build ML worker image
./scripts/dev/build-ml-worker.sh

# Push to ECR and deploy to Fargate
./scripts/dev/push-ml-worker.sh
```

### 4. Test the Flow
```bash
# Upload a lab report via API
# Check SQS queue
aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
  --queue-url $(terraform output -raw ml_worker_queue_url) \
  --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages

# Check Fargate task status
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster production-ml-worker \
  --services production-ml-worker-service
```

---

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Logs
- **Log Group:** `/ecs/production-ml-worker`
- **Streams:** One per Fargate task execution

```bash
# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/production-ml-worker --follow
```

### SQS Metrics
- `ApproximateNumberOfMessages` - Current queue depth
- `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` - Processing lag
- `NumberOfMessagesReceived` - Throughput
- `NumberOfMessagesSent` - Incoming rate

### ECS Metrics
- `RunningTasksCount` - Should be 0 when idle, 1 when processing
- `CPUUtilization` - ML processing load
- `MemoryUtilization` - BioBERT model memory usage

---

## Fallback Behavior

If ML Worker is disabled or unavailable:
```python
if ml_worker_client.is_enabled():
    ml_worker_client.send_lab_processing_trigger(user_id)
else:
    logger.warning("⚠️  ML worker is not enabled, lab will be processed by background worker")
```

The existing background worker on EC2 will continue to process pending labs as a fallback.

## All Domains Migrated to SQS! 🎉

**Status: COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Labs:** SQS + Fargate Spot (scale-to-zero)
- ✅ **Vitals:** SQS + Fargate Spot (scale-to-zero)
- ✅ **Nutrition:** SQS + Fargate Spot (scale-to-zero)

**Benefits:**
- Full scale-to-zero for ALL aggregation workloads
- Maximum cost savings (~$28.80/month)
- Exact same processing logic and order maintained
- No assumptions or changes to core algorithms

**What Changed:**
1. Replaced `trigger_smart_aggregation()` with SQS triggers in:
   - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/vitals.py` (3 locations)
   - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/nutrition.py` (1 location)
   - `backend/app/agentsv2/vitals_agent.py` (1 location)
   - `backend/app/agentsv2/nutrition_agent.py` (1 location)
   - `backend/app/agentsv2/lab_agent.py` (1 location)

2. Added processing handlers in `ml_worker.py` that replicate exact logic from `background_worker.py`

3. Background worker on EC2 is now DEPRECATED (but kept as fallback if SQS disabled)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: SQS messages not being sent
```bash
# Check API logs
docker logs zivohealth-api 2>&1 | grep "ML worker"

# Verify ML_WORKER_ENABLED is set
docker exec zivohealth-api printenv | grep ML_WORKER
```

### Issue: Worker not starting
```bash
# Check queue depth
aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url <url> --attribute-names All

# Check ECS service
aws ecs describe-services --cluster production-ml-worker --services production-ml-worker-service

# Check CloudWatch alarms
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name-prefix production-ml-worker
```

### Issue: Messages going to DLQ
```bash
# Check dead-letter queue
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url <dlq-url> --max-number-of-messages 10

# Analyze failed message
# Check CloudWatch logs for errors
```
