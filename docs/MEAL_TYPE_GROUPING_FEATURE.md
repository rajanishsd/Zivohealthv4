# Meal Type Grouping Feature

## Overview
Implemented a two-layer meal display system that groups meals by meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack) with aggregated nutrition data.

## Architecture

### 1. Data Model (`MealTypeGroup.swift`)
- **Location**: `apps/iOS/Zivohealth/Sources/Models/MealTypeGroup.swift`
- **Purpose**: Groups meals by meal type and provides aggregated nutrition calculations
- **Key Features**:
  - Groups meals by `MealType` (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, other)
  - Calculates total calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium
  - Aggregates vitamins (A, C, D) and minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium)
  - Extension on `[NutritionDataResponse]` for easy grouping

### 2. Level 1 View - Meal Type Card (`MealTypeCard.swift`)
- **Location**: `apps/iOS/Zivohealth/Sources/Views/MealTypeCard.swift`
- **Purpose**: Top-level card showing aggregated nutrition for a meal type
- **Features**:
  - Displays meal type emoji and name
  - Shows total meal count for the type
  - Highlights total calories prominently
  - Shows macronutrients grid (Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fiber)
  - Tap gesture to view detailed summary

### 3. Level 2 View - Meal Type Summary (`MealTypeSummaryView.swift`)
- **Location**: `apps/iOS/Zivohealth/Sources/Views/MealTypeSummaryView.swift`
- **Purpose**: Detailed view showing all meals within a meal type
- **Features**:
  - **Custom Header**: Branded header with meal type info
  - **Aggregated Summary Card**:
    - Total nutrition for all meals in the type
    - Macronutrients with icons
    - Vitamins & Minerals grid (when available)
  - **Individual Meals List**:
    - Each meal displayed as a card
    - Tap to open `MealDetailView`
    - Shows time, name, calories, macros
    - Photo indicator if available

### 4. Updated Meals List View (`NutritionView.swift`)
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced flat meal list with meal type grouping
  - Added horizontal scrolling page view for meal type cards
  - Each card width is (screen width - 48px) for nice spacing
  - Updated "Recent Meals" preview to show grouped meals
  - Added state management for meal type detail navigation

## User Flow

### Main Nutrition View
1. User opens Nutrition tab
2. Sees "Today's Meals by Type" section
3. Shows top 2 meal type groups as compact cards
4. Tap "See All" to navigate to full meals list

### Meals List View
1. Shows date picker
2. Horizontal scrollable page view of meal type cards
3. Each card shows:
   - Meal type emoji and name
   - Meal count
   - Total calories (prominent)
   - Macronutrients grid
4. Swipe left/right to view different meal types

### Meal Type Summary
1. Tap a meal type card
2. Opens sheet with:
   - Custom header with meal type info
   - Aggregated summary of all nutrition
   - List of individual meals
3. Tap individual meal â†’ opens `MealDetailView`

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design Consistency
- Uses existing Zivo brand colors (zivoRed gradient)
- Consistent card styling with shadows
- Familiar nutrition badges and icons
- Smooth sheet presentations

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Level 1**: Meal Type Cards (Page View)
  - Large emoji
  - Prominent calories
  - 4-column macro grid
  
- **Level 2**: Meal Type Summary
  - Detailed aggregated summary
  - Individual meal cards with tap targets
  
- **Level 3**: Meal Detail View (existing)
  - Full nutritional breakdown
  - Image viewing
  - All vitamins & minerals

### Responsive Design
- Cards adapt to screen width
- Horizontal scrolling prevents overcrowding
- Proper safe area handling
- Support for both portrait and landscape

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
```swift
// Model
struct MealTypeGroup: Identifiable {
    let mealType: MealType
    let meals: [NutritionDataResponse]
    // Computed properties for aggregated nutrition
}

// Extension for easy grouping
extension Array where Element == NutritionDataResponse {
    func groupedByMealType() -> [MealTypeGroup]
}

// Views
- MealTypeCard: Level 1 card component
- MealTypeSummaryView: Level 2 detail view
- Updated MealsListView: Container with page view
```

### State Management
```swift
@State private var showingMealTypeSummary = false
@State private var selectedMealTypeGroup: MealTypeGroup?
@State private var showingMealTypeDetail = false
@State private var selectedMealTypeGroupForDetail: MealTypeGroup?
```

### Navigation Pattern
- Uses SwiftUI sheets for modals
- Smooth transitions between levels
- Back buttons with branded styling
- Maintains navigation stack properly

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Better Organization**: Meals grouped logically by type
2. **Quick Overview**: See totals at a glance
3. **Easy Navigation**: Swipe between meal types
4. **Context Aware**: Understand meal distribution throughout day

### For Developers
1. **Reusable Components**: Modular card and view design
2. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add more aggregations
4. **Type Safe**: Leverages Swift's type system

## Files Modified
1. `apps/iOS/Zivohealth/Sources/Views/NutritionView.swift`
   - Added meal type grouping logic
   - Updated recent meals preview
   - Added navigation state management
